> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This dashboard uses 100% SYNTHETIC/FAKE data for educational purposes only. Not for production use.**

A comprehensive real-time payment monitoring dashboard simulating Canada's Real-Time Rail (RTR) payment system with **AI/ML-powered risk detection**, based on Payments Canada ISO 20022 specifications v1.4. **All transactions, bank names, and payment data shown are completely fake and randomly generated.**

## ✨ Features

### 🏦 Real-Time Payment Simulation (with Synthetic Data)
- **ISO 20022-compliant** fake message generation (pacs.008, pacs.002)
- **10+ simulated Canadian banks** with actual headquarters locations (Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Vancouver, Ottawa, Levis)
- **Fake payment flows** with simulated liquidity management between institutions
- **Configurable fake transaction patterns** including normal payments, high-value wires, and structuring attempts

### 🤖 AI/ML Risk Detection (on Fake Data)
- **Isolation Forest** unsupervised learning trained on synthetic data
- **Multi-factor risk scoring** on simulated transactions
- **Real-time ML model training** on fake streaming data
- **Adaptive learning** that improves on made-up patterns
- **Automated flagging** of suspicious fake transactions

### 🗺️ Interactive Visualizations
- **Geographic map** of Canada with real bank headquarters (but fake transactions)
- **Live fake transaction timeline** with color-coded risk indicators
- **Simulated bank liquidity monitoring** with dynamic color gradients
- **Network graph** showing fake payment flows between institutions
- **Risk heat maps** highlighting made-up high-activity corridors
